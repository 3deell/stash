monkeypatching(3) --- MANAGING PATCHES
======================================

StaSh provides the "monkeylord" command for managing monkeypatches.

Usage:
   "monkeylord -h" to get help
   "monkeylord list" to get a list of all patches and their state
   "monkeylord enable [NAME]" to enable patches
   "monkeylord disable [NAME]" to disable patches

The optional argument NAME defines the patch(es) to enable/disable.
It defaults to "STABLE" for "monkeylord enable" and "ALL" for "monkeylord disable".
To get a list of available patches and some help, see the "Patches"-Chapter.
